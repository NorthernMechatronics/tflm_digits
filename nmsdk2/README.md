## Overview
NMSDK is an Northern Mechatronics initiative to reduce development efforts, time and cost.

The NMSDK covers the overall NM product portfolio.  It includes a comprehesive
embedded software platform, radio drivers, and communication protocol stacks.

* The hardware abstraction layer and CMSIS module corresponding to the ARM(tm) core implemented in the processor.
* A collection of communication protocol stacks such as LoRaWAN, BLE, and more.
* FreeRTOS enabling applications to operate multiple radios simultaneously.
* Target specific implementation of libraries.

## Description
The SDK is meant to be used in conjunction with the application template.
Please refer to the Getting Started Guide in nmapp2 for further information.
