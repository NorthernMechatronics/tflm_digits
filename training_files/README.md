# How to train a model

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how to train a machine learning model designed for digit recognition. We are going to use publicly available datasets to demonstrate, in particular, the Street View House Numbers (SVHN) dataset created by Stanford researchers.

## What are convolutional neural networks (CNN)?

Convolutional neural networks (CNN) compose of one type of neural networks where there are convolution layers within the model itself. This is different from other networks because convolutional layers play a key role when recognizing certain features within the input. In the case of this project, we are concerned with how a model intakes an image and processes it to produce a prediction.
